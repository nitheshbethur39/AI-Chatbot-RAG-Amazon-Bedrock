# 🧠 AI Chatbot with RAG & Amazon Bedrock

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building an AI-powered chatbot using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Amazon Bedrock**. The chatbot can retrieve and process information from a **Knowledge Base** stored in **Amazon S3** to provide accurate responses.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Workflow
1️⃣ **User Query:** The chatbot receives a question from the user.
2️⃣ **AI Model Processing:** Amazon Bedrock processes the query and determines the needed information.
3️⃣ **Data Retrieval:** The chatbot retrieves relevant data from the Knowledge Base stored in **Amazon S3**.
4️⃣ **Response Generation:** The AI model structures the retrieved data into a meaningful response.

## 🛠️ AWS Services Used
- **Amazon Bedrock** - AI model hosting for chatbot responses
- **Amazon S3** - Storing knowledge base documents
- **IAM Roles & Policies** - Secure access control for Bedrock and S3
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** - Enabling context-aware responses

## 📂 Project Files & Directories
- **README.md** - Documentation of the project
- **Architecture Diagram** - Visual representation of the chatbot workflow
- **Example IAM Policies** - Sample configurations for secure AWS resource access
- **Manifest File (if used)** - Example S3 structure for data retrieval

## 🚀 How to Recreate This Project
Since AWS resources were deleted, follow these steps to understand and rebuild:
1️⃣ **Set up Amazon S3** to store your knowledge base.
2️⃣ **Enable Amazon Bedrock** to access AI models.
3️⃣ **Configure IAM Roles** to allow communication between services.
4️⃣ **Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for AI-driven responses.

## 🎯 Learnings & Challenges
- **Understanding RAG** and its integration with AWS services.
- **Managing S3 Permissions** for smooth data retrieval.
- **Deploying AI models using Amazon Bedrock.**

## 📌 Future Enhancements
✅ **Integrate AWS Lambda** for automated backend processing.
✅ **Add a Web Interface** for interactive chatbot access.
✅ **Enhance Data Preprocessing** to improve chatbot accuracy.

## 💡 Conclusion
This project demonstrated how to build an **AI chatbot that learns from personal documents** using **Amazon Bedrock & RAG**. It showcases skills in **cloud-based AI, knowledge retrieval, and AWS security best practices**.
