# 🧠 AI Chatbot with RAG & Amazon Bedrock

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building an AI-powered chatbot using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Amazon Bedrock**. The chatbot can retrieve and process information from a **Knowledge Base** stored in **Amazon S3** to provide accurate responses.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Workflow
1️⃣ **User Query:** The chatbot receives a question from the user.
2️⃣ **AI Model Processing:** Amazon Bedrock processes the query and determines the needed information.
3️⃣ **Data Retrieval:** The chatbot retrieves relevant data from the Knowledge Base stored in **Amazon S3**.
4️⃣ **Response Generation:** The AI model structures the retrieved data into a meaningful response.
